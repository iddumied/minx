TODO:

1) reserve more status registers for internal use.
2) opcodes in a map (opcode -> function), not in a big switch.
3) (important!) the VM is 16-Bit right now. Patch to 64 Bit, 24 Bit op codes.
4) overflow value is not set into overflow-value-register

5) TODO op codes:

- define a op code for defining op-codes.
  Something like this:

    DEF(opc, funcloc)

  where opc is the opcode to define (or redefine). It will be automatically
  masked for 24 bit.
  The funcloc is a pointer to a function which is defined somewhere in the
  binary. This function is read into the VM and stored there. If the op code
  which was defined is used, the VM executes the stored procedure.

  There should be some status registers reserved for statuses about the call.
