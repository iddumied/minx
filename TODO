TODO:

4) overflow value is not set into overflow-value-register

5) define a op code for defining op-codes.
	Something like this:

	DEF(opc, funcloc)

	where opc is the opcode to define (or redefine). It will be automatically
	masked for 16 bit.
	The funcloc is a pointer to a function which is defined somewhere in the
	binary. This function is read into the VPU and stored there. If the op code
	which was defined is used, the VPU executes the stored procedure.

	There should be some status registers reserved for statuses about the call.
		-	was a override
		-	worked/error

5.1)define a op code ISDEV(reg, opc) for getting if a opcode is defined, result
	in 'reg'

9)	File reader should read the file as linked list, with automatically removing 
	"old" parts of the file from memory to keep memuse smart.

12) Implement heap:
	- opcode for starting heap allocation
	- opcode for adding space to heap (slot)
	- opcode for ending heap allocation
	- heap addressable with code, every slot addressable with opcode
