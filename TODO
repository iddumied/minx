TODO:

- There is no check function if a register exists before accessing it.
- Registers have to be allocated on the fly, but if a command accesses 
	
	register 0xFF 

  all registers from 0x00 to 0xFF have to be allocated.

  -> Store the registers in a MAP, maybe the one from next utilc version?
