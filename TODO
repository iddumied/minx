TODO:

9)	File reader should read the file as linked list, with automatically removing 
	"old" parts of the file from memory to keep memuse smart. 
	A very tricky algorithm is required here!

17.1) (addition to already done TODO #17) Organize the memory map, for fast
		memory lookup and so on. The map has to be ordered to do a fast lookup
		of the memory!

22) Interrupts? What about interrupts? We need a jump-to address for a
	interrupt and a way to register this address for a particular interrupt type
	such as SIGINT.

28) Thread save VPU ? Would be so damn great!

34) work on --fast option, ensure the VPU caches as much as possible.

35) Add step by step debugging
