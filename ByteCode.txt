minx virtual processing unit specification
------------------------------------------

- opcode is 16 Bit
- registers are addressed with 16 Bit
- values are 64 bit 
- Program-adresses are 64 bit

The minx vpu is _stupid_. You can jump to _every_ location in the binary, if it
exists. So you or your compiler has to care about the jumps, the machine
does not. It only checks, if the code position exists. If not, it stops
executing with printing a fatal error message.

special registers:
------------------
Registers 0x00 to 0xAF are special, they are not useable for program data, but
anyway accessible for the program.

- 0x0000	Programm-ptr, is zero at init and (uint64_t)-1 at end of programm
- 0x0001	(unused yet)
- 0x0002	akku-register
- 0x0003	status-register 
				Bit	|	use 
				----+-------
				0	|	overflow 
                1   |   heapalloc status (1: worked, 0: failure)
				1-7	|	not used yet
- 0x0004	overflow value 
- 0x0005-0x00AF (unused yet, will be used for more status registers and stuff)

So, 0x00B0 is the first register which should be used for program data. With
current implementation, there are 2^8 registers, so 0x0000FFFF is the last
register. Registers are addressed with 16 bit because if the machine should
provide more registers later on, there are just small changes.

So, 176 Registers for special use, 256 Registers all in all, makes 82 Registers
for program data.

stack 
-----
- infinite size (only limited by your system)
- used for both function calls and pushing values

opcodes
-------

'Register'	    stands for 16 Bit (2 Byte) register address (shortcut 'reg')

'Value'		    stands for 64 Bit (8 Byte) value

'Adress'	    stands for 64 Bit (8 Byte) code address

'Memory'        stands for 16 Bit (2 Byte) register address where a memory
                address is stored, this memory has to be the first byte address 
                of allocated memory!

'MemoryAddr'    stands for 16 Bit (2 Byte) register address where a memory
                address is stored. This memory address can be anywhere in the 
                memory!

'offset'        stands for memory offset in byte

'size'          stands for size in byte, maximal 8

Maximal 5 parameters at the moment!

These are special debugging opcodes and are only print when compiled with 
DEBUGGING and started with "-d" flag. If not compiled with DEBUGGING, they
will be ignored automatically! The 0x5? block is reserved for them.

Heap opcodes:
- the address of the memory is _always_ the first byte!
- the size of the memory is in byte.
